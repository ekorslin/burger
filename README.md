# Eat-Da-Burger App

Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM, I've built the perfect app for burger enthusiasts and foodies everywhere.  Eat-Da-Burger serves as a bucket list, of sorts, for its users to more easily remember the names of those mouth-watering burgers that have crossed their minds in recent past.  It even features an option to check off those burgers the user has had a chance to devour, reminding them of those they've yet to try.  

Users are encouraged to try out the app by clicking [here](https://thawing-beach-52915.herokuapp.com/).
